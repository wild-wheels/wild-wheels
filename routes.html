	<h4>Off to Norway</h4>
			Norway is home to many breathtaking scenery, including calm forests, deep fjords, and high mountains. Even though the scenery is striking, there's a sense of peace that encourages you to take it easy and enjoy the experience. Whether you're hiking, driving through the countryside, or simply admiring the scenery, this is the type of area where you want to be outside.<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Overnight stays</h4>
			There are several choices for overnight accommodations for campervan users in Norway. The Right to Roam law permits wild camping for a maximum of two nights on uncultivated land as long as you are at least 150 meters away from buildings. However, it is prohibited to drive or park on such property without authorization. Official campsites are generally accessible and include facilities like Wi-Fi, power, and showers for added comfort. To help protect Norway's stunning landscapes, always abide by local laws, show consideration for the environment, and dispose of waste appropriately.<br>

			Phone Number: +47 23 33 36 00<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Toll roads and vignettes</h4>
			In Norway, there are no toll booths; instead, toll highways are controlled automatically. Instead, cameras scan your license plate, and costs are charged via systems like EPC for foreign vehicles and AutoPASS for local cars. To avoid additional costs, it's crucial to register with EPC within three days if you're importing your vehicle into Norway. In Norway, tolls are charged per use on designated roads, bridges, tunnels, and city zones; there is no vignette system. Reduced or free tolls are frequently useful for electric vehicles. Tolls are automatically billed because the majority of rental automobiles come with an AutoPASS tag.<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Fuel and Charging stations</h4>
			There are plenty of EV charging stations and gas stations throughout Norway. Diesel and gasoline (95/98) are widely available, and self-service outlets such as Circle K, Shell, and Uno-X are open around-the-clock. In rural areas, it's best to refuel early because rates are high compared to other countries and payment usually happens with a card. Additionally, Norway has one of the world's greatest networks for charging EVs. Normal AC chargers, 50 kW rapid DC chargers, and ultra-speed (150–350 kW) chargers are also available. Recharge, Mer, Ionity, and Tesla are some of the major suppliers. Although many stations now accept contactless cards, charging usually requires an app or RFID card.<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Driving in Norway</h4>
			If you have a valid license from your native country, you can drive in Norway for a maximum of three months.<br>
			- 50 km/h in cities.<br>
			- 80–90 km/h outside of towns.<br>
			- 100–110 km/h on highways.<br>
			Driving is done on the right side of the road.<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Bringing pets</h4>
			To bring your pet into Norway, you’ll need a pet passport with details on vaccinations, including a rabies vaccination (administered at least 21 days before travel). Pets must have a microchip for identification. Dogs also require a tapeworm treatment 1-5 days before entry (for non-EU countries). If traveling by car, you can enter via routes like the Swedish-Norwegian border, but your pet must still meet all health requirements. Make sure to check for any breed restrictions and possible fees for inspection or quarantine.<br>
	<br>
