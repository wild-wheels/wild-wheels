	<strong>Introduction</strong><br>
In a world where adventure is becoming increasingly important, Wild Wheels not only provides the means to get on the road, but also the guidance to do so in the best possible way. We understand that travellers like to choose their own path, but at the same time they need guidance, inspiration and reliable information in one place.
This Communications and Media Plan describes our strategy to achieve this goal. It shows how we build brand awareness and generate traffic to our website.<br>
	<br><strong>Target Audience</strong><br>
Wild Wheels’ target group consists of adventurous young people between the ages of 18 and 30, who live in the Netherlands. They are often students or starters with a limited budget but still want smart and affordable solutions for their travels. They love road trips, camping, surfing and festivals, and are always looking for inspiration for new adventures.
These young people use platforms like YouTube, Instagram and TikTok to get ideas, find tips and learn from others who have been on adventures before. They are looking for practical solutions and inspiration to make their travels comfortable and sustainable, so that they can make the most of their time in nature.<br>
	<br><strong>Brand Voice</strong><br>
Whild Wheels stands for inspiration and guidance. We help people find their way to freedom and adventure with a clear and motivating tone. Our communication is direct, energetic and purposeful.<br>
	<br><strong>Platform</strong><br>
Whild Wheels uses Instagram because it perfectly matches our visual style. We want to convey our message primarily through photos, which is why we chose not to use TikTok, which focuses on videos, despite its popularity among our target audience.
Instagram is set to be the third largest social network worldwide by 2025, with over 2 billion monthly users. Instagram is particularly popular among our target audience of 18–30-year-olds. In the US for example, 76% of adults aged 18-29 use Instagram (Team, 2025). Sharing photos allows us to build a consistent brand identity and interact more easily with our community. Instagram is easy to use and allows us to build authentic relationships with our customers, which contributes to greater engagement.<br>
	<br><strong>Consistent Communication</strong><br>
Whild Wheels maintains a consistent brand image across all platforms. Our core values: guidance, inspiration, adventure and sustainability, are central to every message.<br>
	<br><strong>Tone of Voice</strong><br>
Our tone of voice is positive, inspiring, and accessible. We engage our community with a mix of enthusiasm and expertise, challenging and supporting people. On social media, the emphasis is on visually strong content that reflects the adventurous lifestyle.<br>
	<br><strong>Justifications Social Media</strong><br>
We combine inspiring stories, practical tips, and interactive content to stimulate engagement and build an active community. Additionally, we stay true to our brand identity by adhering to our style guide, incorporating our specific shades of green and white across all posts and visuals. This consistency in colour enhances our brand recognition and reinforces the feeling of adventure and sustainability that Wild Wheels stands for.<br>
<br><strong>Week 1</strong><br>
The first week was focused on introducing our brand. We explained who we are, what we stand for and what we have to offer. That’s why the captions were longer, so we could share more information. We also focused on increasing our reach by actively following other people and gaining more followers.
<br><strong>Week 2</strong><br>
The second week focused on engaging with our followers. Captions were shorter and more focused on the viewer of the post. We also continued to actively build our following.
<br><strong>Week 3</strong><br>
We noticed that followers were particularly active in responding to our stories, especially the Dilemma Tuesday which was a hit. These posts generated a high number of viewers. That is why we decided to repost the Instagram posts in the stories as well, hoping that this would generate more interaction on the posts themselves.
<br><strong>Week 4</strong><br>
the focus was even more on interaction. We used polls and quizzes to get conversations going and noticed that followers responded well to this. However, we are struggling to get real interaction. We do see that followers view the posts but comments and likes on the posts are absent.<br>
	<br><strong>Timing</strong><br>
Using data from Shopify, we researched the most effective times to post on Instagram. Shopify provides valuable insights into when users are most active, allowing us to optimize our posting strategy for maximum engagement (Wat Is de Beste Tijd Om op Instagram te Posten in 2024?, z.d.).<br>
