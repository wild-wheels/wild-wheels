	<h4>Introduction</h4>
In a world where adventure is becoming increasingly important, Wild Wheels not only provides the means to get on the road, but also the guidance to do so in the best possible way. We understand that travellers like to choose their own path, but at the same time they need guidance, inspiration and reliable information in one place.
This Communications and Media Plan describes our strategy to achieve this goal. It shows how we build brand awareness and generate traffic to our website.<br>
	<br><h4>Target Audience</h4>
Wild Wheels’ target group consists of adventurous young people between the ages of 18 and 30, who live in the Netherlands. They are often students or starters with a limited budget but still want smart and affordable solutions for their travels. They love road trips, camping, surfing and festivals, and are always looking for inspiration for new adventures.
These young people use platforms like YouTube, Instagram and TikTok to get ideas, find tips and learn from others who have been on adventures before. They are looking for practical solutions and inspiration to make their travels comfortable and sustainable, so that they can make the most of their time in nature.<br>
	<br><h4>Brand Voice</h4>
Whild Wheels stands for inspiration and guidance. We help people find their way to freedom and adventure with a clear and motivating tone. Our communication is direct, energetic and purposeful.<br>
	<br><h4>Platform</h4>
Whild Wheels uses Instagram because it perfectly matches our visual style. We want to convey our message primarily through photos, which is why we chose not to use TikTok, which focuses on videos, despite its popularity among our target audience.
Instagram is set to be the third largest social network worldwide by 2025, with over 2 billion monthly users. Instagram is particularly popular among our target audience of 18–30-year-olds. In the US for example, 76% of adults aged 18-29 use Instagram (Team, 2025). Sharing photos allows us to build a consistent brand identity and interact more easily with our community. Instagram is easy to use and allows us to build authentic relationships with our customers, which contributes to greater engagement.<br>
	<br><h4>Consistent Communication</h4>
Whild Wheels maintains a consistent brand image across all platforms. Our core values: guidance, inspiration, adventure and sustainability, are central to every message.<br>
	<br><h4>Tone of Voice</h4>
Our tone of voice is positive, inspiring, and accessible. We engage our community with a mix of enthusiasm and expertise, challenging and supporting people. On social media, the emphasis is on visually strong content that reflects the adventurous lifestyle.<br>
	<br><h4>Justifications Social Media</h4>
We combine inspiring stories, practical tips, and interactive content to stimulate engagement and build an active community. Additionally, we stay true to our brand identity by adhering to our style guide, incorporating our specific shades of green and white across all posts and visuals. This consistency in colour enhances our brand recognition and reinforces the feeling of adventure and sustainability that Wild Wheels stands for.<br>
<br><strong>Week 1</strong><br>
The first week was focused on introducing our brand. We explained who we are, what we stand for and what we have to offer. That’s why the captions were longer, so we could share more information. We also focused on increasing our reach by actively following other people and gaining more followers.
<br><strong>Week 2</strong><br>
The second week focused on engaging with our followers. Captions were shorter and more focused on the viewer of the post. We also continued to actively build our following.
<br><strong>Week 3</strong><br>
We noticed that followers were particularly active in responding to our stories, especially the Dilemma Tuesday which was a hit. These posts generated a high number of viewers. That is why we decided to repost the Instagram posts in the stories as well, hoping that this would generate more interaction on the posts themselves.
<br><strong>Week 4</strong><br>
the focus was even more on interaction. We used polls and quizzes to get conversations going and noticed that followers responded well to this. However, we are struggling to get real interaction. We do see that followers view the posts but comments and likes on the posts are absent.<br>
	<br><h4>Timing</h4>
Using data from Shopify, we researched the most effective times to post on Instagram. Shopify provides valuable insights into when users are most active, allowing us to optimize our posting strategy for maximum engagement (Wat Is de Beste Tijd Om op Instagram te Posten in 2024?, z.d.).<br>
	<br><h4>KPIs</h4>
<br><strong>Response</strong>
<br>Goal: I will post 3 times per week on Instagram for the next 4 weeks, including at least 2 stories per week, using relevant hashtags, location tags and interactive elements such as polls or question stickers to increase my visibility and engagement<br>
<br><strong>Outcome</strong>
<br>
Like goal: Each post will receive an average of 5-10 likes over the next 4 weeks, as measured by Meta Insights.<br>
Comment goal: Each post will receive an average of 1-3 comments over the next 4 weeks, as measured by Meta Insights.<br>
Share goal: Each post will be shared 2-5 times over the next 4 weeks, as shown in Meta Insights.<br>
Impact<br>
<br><strong>Impact</strong>
<br>In the next 4 weeks I want to attract at least 50 Instagram followers, measured via Meta Insights, through consistent content, relevant hashtags and possible collaborations.<br>

	<h4>What makes us different?</h4>
		We offer a complete, all-in-one campervan travel solution which allows travelers to easily plan their routes, locate trustworthy information, and combine must-see locations with necessary stops all on a single, user-friendly platform. We provide a customized experience made especially for campervan travelers, in contrast to dispersed internet forums, out-of-date guidebooks, and generic map apps.<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Why we're worth paying attention to:</h4>
	<strong>Reliable, up-to-date information in one place</strong><br>
			No more searching through several sources, our platform collects the most up to date, precise information on campgrounds, campervan friendly routes, gas stations, dump stations, and laws.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Smart route planning made for vanlife</strong><br>
			In contrast to other GPS programs, we assist you in mapping out the most picturesque routes, rest areas, and undiscovered treasures, ensuring that your trip is both effective and memorable.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Effortless activity and sighhtseeing integration</strong><br>
			Along your planned path, you may effortlessly combine outdoor activities, cultural experiences, and must-see sites, providing a well-rounded vacation free from the burden of last-minute preparation.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Community powered recommendations</strong><br>
			Build a reliable network of likeminded adventurers by connecting with other campervan travelers to exchange knowledge, advice, and real-time updates.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>User friendly and mobile optimized</strong><br>
			Whether you're making last-minute changes or planning ahead, our user-friendly platform guarantees that everything you need is at your fingertips.<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Why choose us?</h4>
			Because the adventure, not the burden of preparation, should be the main focus of campervan travel. We make road vacations exciting, stress free, and well planned so you can spend more time exploring and less time looking for things.<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Unfair Advantage</h4>
	<strong>Smart route planning with seamless experience integration</strong><br>
			- Activities, sightseeing, and necessary stops (such as gas stations, supermarkets, and EV charging stations for electric campers) are all carefully included in our route planner.<br>
			- Why competitors are unable to replicate this: Traditional GPS and travel apps concentrate on navigation, while our technology customizes the experience for campervan users.<br>
	<strong>Brand trust and niche authority</strong><br>
			- As the most trusted source on campervan travel, we provide not just a planning tool but also in-depth information, insider knowledge, and tried-and-true guidance.<br>  
			- Why competitors are unable to replicate this: Consistent value, accuracy, and community involvement are the basis of brand credibility, which cannot be quickly duplicated.<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Channels:</h4>
			For us to reach out to our customers we use one important media channel and that is Instagram. We want to use Instagram to reach out to our customers, because Instagram matches our visual style and sharing photos allows us to build a consistent brand identity and interact more effectively with our community. Instagram is easy to use and allows us to engage with a broader and greater audience. We will share a post or a story from Monday till Friday to keep our audience informed and give them inspiration. We combine inspiring stories, practical tips, and interactive content to stimulate engagement and build an active community. Additionally, we stay true to our brand identity by adhering to our style guide, incorporating our specific shades of green and white across all posts and visuals. This consistency in colour enhances our brand recognition and reinforces the feeling of adventure and sustainability that Wild Wheels stands for.<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Services and Product</h4>
			Our digital platform serves as a complete travel companion for campervan travellers, tackling the most common problems like as difficult trip planning, complex route planning, and unclear information sources. We offer a comprehensive solution that simplifies the entire travel process, in contrast to outdated guidebooks, scattered internet forums, or basic navigation apps. Without depending on unreliable sources, users can find campsites, authorized parking spaces, gas stations, and service stops with confidence thanks to real-time, confirmed trip data. Our clever route planning tool makes trip planning easy by combining must-see sites, picturesque routes, and necessary pauses. In contrast to other travel resources, our platform is made especially for vanlifers and provides personalized suggestions and off-grid camping locations. We also encourage an active vanlife community where travellers can exchange reviews, advice, and real-world observations, guaranteeing that everyone gains from first-hand knowledge. Our technology combines community-driven insights, accuracy, and efficiency to make campervan travel safer, easier, and more pleasurable. All these aspects contribute to our value proposition. Our service also fits our brand identity which shouts: Sustainability, freedom, flexibility, exploration, adventure, independence. Think about sustainable routes, flexible route planning and adventures activities. After we took the interviews, we came to the conclusion that most campervan users were looking for one clear information source, an easy way to plan their route and combine activities along the way. Then we came to the conclusion that we needed to adjust our value proposition to the outcomes of the interviews.<br>
